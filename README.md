# Bus Mall

## Author: Wenhao Piao

## Lab: 11 - Get started on BusMall 
In this lab, I used the constructor function to create 20 objects and store it in an array. Each object holds some attributes of an image. I randomly selected three different objects in the array and used them to render three images in my image section. I added an event listener and an event handler to image section so that when user clicks an image it will re-render the image section with three different random images. 

## Lab: 12 - Add a chart to your MusMall app  
In this lab, I removed the button and the `show results section` and add a chart to show the total views and total clicks after users complete the voting process. I imported the `chart.js` from MDN and used it to create a chart. 

## Lab: 13 - Add local storage to BusMall 
In this lab, I implemented data persistence for the views and votes so that the app can keep track of aggregate number of views and votes.
